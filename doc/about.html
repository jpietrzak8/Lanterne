<p>
Lanterne is a small app that provides a handful of ways to use the N900's
camera flash and indicator LEDs.  Standard "torch" usage is available, as
well as a continuous pulse, an SOS signal, and a general-purpose Morse code
transmitter.
</p>

<p>
Lanterne is a free and open-source program!  Use it however you like.  But if
you wish to send a few appreciative dollars my way, I do accept
<a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=K697WUWYDLNJA">donations</a>.  
All funds received will be put towards the purchase of another N900 for
development work.  Thank you!
