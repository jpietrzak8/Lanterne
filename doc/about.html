Version 0.5.0
</p>

<p>
Lanterne is a tiny app for messing around with the LEDs used by the N900
to provide a flash for the camera.  If there is interest, it may grow
into something more...
</p>

<p>
Lanterne is a free and open-source program!  Use it however you like.  But if
you wish to send a few appreciative dollars my way, I do accept
<a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=K697WUWYDLNJA">donations</a>.  
All funds received will be put towards the purchase of another N900 for
development work.  Thank you!
